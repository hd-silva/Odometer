# Odometer
Simulates an odomter whose number of digits are user specified. After the user defines the number of digits the odometer should contain, the main method performs the following set of operations and outputs the resulting odometer.
  1) Increment 130 times
  2) Decrement 31 times
  3) Increment 1001 times
  4) Decrement 1101
  5) Reset the odometer and print the count
  6) Decrement once
  7) Increment once

Note: This main method requires an odometer of at least 4 digits to output the correct results, as incrementing/decrementing 1001 times is not allowed in a 1, 2, or 3 digit odometer. It will work on 1, 2, or 3 digit odometers given the main method is adjusted accordingly.
